# What can I do with Pikacloud ?

Pikacloud aims to provide services for Web Applications in a _Cloud agnostic_ way. One simple example sums up Pikacloud advantages:

- Your main HTTP server for yoursite.com runs in AWS EC2,
- your backup HTTP server for yoursite.com runs in Digital Ocean,
- you own a Domain Name at some registar.

Given these elements, Pikacloud allows you to:
- Load Balance your application between your servers hosted in different locations and by different providers,
- automatically secure your application with HTTPS free or already-owned SSL Certificate,
- automatically configure your Domain Name DNS zone.

You can choose any hosting providers for your applications, buy your Domain Names and SSL Certificates anywhere.

Pikacloud fully manages all provided Services and ensure strong [Quality Of Service](#quality-of-service).

# Pricing model

Pikacloud services are billed on a monthly basis.
